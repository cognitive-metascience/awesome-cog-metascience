### Unintended Consequences of Peer Review
* [Is Blinded Review Enough?](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25759?utmcampaign=ntwh&utmmedium=email&utm_source=ntwg16)
Blinded review aims to reduce bias and increase diversity in scientific research. However, a study of Gates Foundation grant proposals found that female applicants received lower scores despite blinded review. This disparity is linked to gender differences in communication styles, not reviewer bias or proposal quality. Female applicants showed greater scientific output after an accepted proposal, highlighting the need to address gender disparities in evaluation.
