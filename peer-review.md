* [The AI Review Lottery: Widespread AI-Assisted Peer Reviews Boost Paper Scores and Acceptance Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02150)
A study on the use of AI-assisted peer reviews in the 2024 International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) found that at least 15.8% of reviews were written with AI assistance, and that AI-assisted reviews were more likely to score higher than human reviews and increase the chances of submission acceptance.

### Biases and Unintended Consequences of Peer Review

* [Is Blinded Review Enough?](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25759?utmcampaign=ntwh&utmmedium=email&utm_source=ntwg16)
Blinded review aims to reduce bias and increase diversity in scientific research. However, a study of Gates Foundation grant proposals found that female applicants received lower scores despite blinded review. This disparity is linked to gender differences in communication styles, not reviewer bias or proposal quality. Female applicants showed greater scientific output after an accepted proposal, highlighting the need to address gender disparities in evaluation.
* [Conservatism Gets Funded? A Field Experiment on the Role of Negative Information in Novel Project Evaluation](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2021.4107)

* [Research funding: past performance is a stronger predictor of future scientific output than reviewer scores](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157719303694)

* [Can large language models provide useful feedback on research papers? A large-scale empirical analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01783)

  GPT-4 can generate scientific feedback on research papers with quality comparable to human peer reviewers:
  * GPT-4's feedback overlaps with human reviewers at similar rates as human-to-human reviewer overlap.
  * Over half of researchers (57.4%) found GPT-4 feedback helpful/very helpful.
  * 82.4% of researchers considered GPT-4 feedback more beneficial than some human reviewers.
  * GPT-4 shows potential in addressing challenges in obtaining timely, high-quality peer reviews, especially for junior researchers or those from under-resourced settings
