* [ Understanding Inconsistent Science (Peter Vickers) ](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/understanding-inconsistent-science-9780199692026?cc=at&lang=en&)

Addressing recent philosophical claims, Peter Vickers examines eight alleged 'inconsistent theories' in the history of science to challenge the oversimplified view that successful theories can tolerate internal inconsistencies. Vickers argues that labeling theories as 'inconsistent science' may depend on reconstructions that deviate from the actual history of science. Genuine inconsistency, when present, demands a context-specific understanding and response. The author cautions against overly general claims about science, highlighting the diverse nature of entities labeled as 'theories' with unique workings and responses to inconsistency. Vickers advocates for a particularist philosophy of science, encouraging an appreciation of the dramatic differences between identified 'inconsistencies in science.'

* [ Two Kinds of Theory: What Psychology Can Learn from Einstein (McGann) ](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0959354320937804)

A century ago, Einstein's distinction between theories of principle and constructive theories highlighted their unique roles, relationships with data, and developmental methods. The article delves into Einstein's model of theory formation, using the distinction to analyze scientific practice in psychology. Recent discussions in psychology advocate for increased theoretical sophistication, aligning with Einstein's view. The authors argue for the value of this distinction, emphasizing the need for a renewed commitment to a natural history of psychology. In psychology, the shift toward theoretical development is deemed essential alongside methodological sophistication.


* [ The Structure of Scientific Theories ](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structure-scientific-theories/)

The article explores the impact of scientific theories, from foundational ones like relativity to emerging disciplines such as cognitive science and GIS. It thoroughly examines the structure of scientific theories through the Syntactic, Semantic, and Pragmatic Views, addressing their composition, function, and relationship to the world. The Syntactic View characterizes theory structure as an uninterpreted axiomatic system, while the Semantic View involves state-space and model/set-theoretic elements. The Pragmatic View introduces internal and external pluralism in theory structure, highlighting the influence of practice, function, and application. Although these views are often perceived as mutually exclusive, the article suggests that they can be complementary, offering diverse insights into the intricate nature of scientific theories.

* [ What distinguishes data from models? (Leonelli) ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30873249/)

The paper presents a framework to delineate the epistemic roles of data and models in empirical inquiry, critiquing Suppes' characterization for its inadequacy in explaining their roles in scientific practice. Using a case study in plant phenotyping, the author illustrates the difference between practices aiming to make data usable as evidence and those intending to use data to represent specific phenomena. The argument contends that the classification of objects as data or models is not contingent on intrinsic differences in physical properties, abstraction levels, or human intervention but on their distinctive roles in identifying and characterizing targets of investigation. The proposed characterization builds on Suppes' focus on data practices, avoiding the need for a rigid hierarchy or restrictive definition of data models as statistical constructs. The framework contributes to a nuanced understanding of the interplay between data and models in scientific inquiry.

* [ Theory and ontology in behavioural science (Janna Hastings, Susan Michie & Marie Johnston) ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0826-9)

The article discusses the pivotal role of ontologies in cognitive science, serving as computable representations that aid in evidence aggregation and the resolution of theoretical debates. Through the explicit definition of entities across different theories, ontologies establish connections, illustrated by the example of 'perceived control' encompassing entities from various theories. The comparability of theories hinges on addressing identical entities, determining congruence or contradiction. Drawing parallels with successful examples from the natural sciences, the article advocates for integrating overarching theories in cognitive science. However, adopting theories in behavioral sciences poses a challenge due to numerous competing alternative entities, necessitating a principled approach. The suggested integrative approach based on ontologies underscores the importance of explicitly defining entities and relations for empirical annotation, striving towards a cumulative science.


* [ Systematizing the theoretical virtues ](https://philarchive.org/rec/KEASTT-2)

The author explores twelve major virtues of good theories, categorizing them into four classes: evidential, coherential, aesthetic, and diachronic. These virtues include evidential accuracy, causal adequacy, explanatory depth, internal consistency, internal coherence, universal coherence, beauty, simplicity, unification, durability, fruitfulness, and applicability. The classification system follows a pattern of progressive disclosure and expansion within each class. The article aims to clarify the virtues and propose their coordinated and cumulative role in theory formation and evaluation across disciplines. The author argues for an informal and flexible logic of theory choice, emphasizing the multifaceted relationships among the virtues. This systematization provides resources for future prescriptive studies and potential collaboration among logicians, epistemologists, and practitioners across disciplines.

* [ The Cognitive Structure of Scientific Theories (Giere) ](https://www.jstor.org/stable/188213)

This paper advocates for a model-theoretic approach to comprehending the nature of scientific theories, drawing connections between philosophers' model-theoretic accounts and cognitive scientists' categorization concepts. The author proposes a more intricate structure for families of models, contrasting common assumptions. Using classical mechanics as an illustration, the paper suggests mapping families of models with "horizontal" graded structures, multiple hierarchical "vertical" structures, and local "radial" structures. These proposed structures have significant implications for the learning and application of scientific theories in real scientific practice.


* [ How to Build a Theory in Cognitive Science (Hardcastle, 1995) ](https://philpapers.org/rec/HARHTB)

* [ Automatic ontology construction from text: a review from shallow to deep learning trend (Al-aswadi et al., 2020) ] (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337112076_Automatic_ontology_construction_from_text_a_review_from_shallow_to_deep_learning_trend)

The paper explores the field of automatic ontology construction from textual data on the web, driven by the need to promote the semantic web. Ontology learning (OL) from text is the process of extracting and representing knowledge in machine-readable form. Ontologies play a crucial role in enhancing knowledge representation on the semantic web, benefiting applications like information retrieval, extraction, and question answering. Manual ontology construction is time-consuming and costly, leading to the development of various automated approaches and systems. The paper reviews these approaches, systems, and challenges, highlighting the shift from shallow learning to deep learning techniques for future ontology construction enhancements. The introduction emphasizes the significance of ontologies in the semantic web and addresses the need for efficient and automated construction processes.


* [ How to Map Theory: Reliable Methods Are Fruitless Without Rigorous Theory (Gray) ](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e57f82eb306fc38c7637f33/t/5ed5662c14bfa61ddbf90813/1591043629199/how-to-map-theory.pdf)

This article emphasizes the importance of combining reliable methods with rigorous theory in scientific research. It introduces the concept of Action Identification, suggesting psychological tension between focusing on methodological details and noticing broader connections. The paper proposes a technique called theory mapping to visually outline theories, providing specificity and synthesis. Theory mapping involves five elements and is illustrated using examples from moral judgment and cars. The technique is seen as a valuable resource for the scientific community, offering benefits such as specificity, preventing redundancies, increasing validity and reliability, and aiding in theory evaluation. The article concludes that while psychology has focused on methodological reliability, there is a need to improve the rigor of theory, and theory mapping serves as a useful tool for connecting ideas and building knowledge structures. The article also highlights theory maps available on www.theorymaps.org, showcasing various psychological phenomena mapped by experts.

The authors used information-theoretic measure of linguistic similarity to investigate the organization and evolution of scientific fields. An analysis of almost 20 M papers from the past three decades reveals that the linguistic similarity is related but different from experts and citation-based classifications, leading to an improved view on the organization of science. A temporal analysis of the similarity of fields shows that some fields (e.g. computer science) are becoming increasingly central, but that on average the similarity between pairs of disciplines has not changed in the last decades. This suggests that tendencies of convergence (e.g. multi-disciplinarity) and divergence (e.g. specialization) of disciplines are in balance.
