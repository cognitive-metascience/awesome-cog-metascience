The Pragmatic View introduces internal and external pluralism in theory structure, highlighting the influence of practice, function, and application. Although these views are often perceived as mutually exclusive, the article suggests that they can be complementary, offering diverse insights into the intricate nature of scientific theories.

* [ What distinguishes data from models? (Leonelli) ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30873249/)

The paper presents a framework to delineate the epistemic roles of data and models in empirical inquiry, critiquing Suppes' characterization for its inadequacy in explaining their roles in scientific practice. Using a case study in plant phenotyping, the author illustrates the difference between practices aiming to make data usable as evidence and those intending to use data to represent specific phenomena. The argument contends that the classification of objects as data or models is not contingent on intrinsic differences in physical properties, abstraction levels, or human intervention but on their distinctive roles in identifying and characterizing targets of investigation. The proposed characterization builds on Suppes' focus on data practices, avoiding the need for a rigid hierarchy or restrictive definition of data models as statistical constructs. The framework contributes to a nuanced understanding of the interplay between data and models in scientific inquiry.

* [ Under what conditions does theory obstruct research progress? (Greenwald et al., 1986): ](https://faculty.washington.edu/agg/pdf/Gwald_Pratk_Leip_Baumg_PsychRev_1986.OCR.pdf)

Researchers display confirmation bias when they persevere by revising procedures until obtaining a theory-predicted result. This strategy produces findings that are overgeneralized in avoidable ways, and this in turn hinders successful applications. (The 40-year history of an attitude-change phenomenon, the sleeper effect, stands as a case in point.) Confirmation bias is an expectable product of theory-centered research strategies, including both the puzzle-solving activity of T. S. Kuhn's "normal science" and, more surprisingly, K. R. Popper's recommended method of falsification seeking. The alternative strategies of condition seeking (identifying limiting conditions for a known finding) and design (discovering conditions that can produce a previously unobtained result) are result-centered; they are directed at producing specified patterns of data rather than at the logically impossible goals of establishing either the truth or falsity of a theory.

The author explores strategies for generating innovative hypotheses in psychological research. Drawing upon insights from cognitive psychology and creative thinking, McGuire presents a collection of heuristic techniques aimed at stimulating novel ideas and hypotheses in the realm of psychology. Through a blend of theoretical discussion and practical examples, McGuire elucidates various heuristic approaches, including analogical reasoning, counterfactual thinking, and divergent thinking. He emphasizes the importance of flexibility, openness to unconventional ideas, and willingness to challenge established assumptions in the hypothesis generation process. Furthermore, McGuire discusses how these heuristic strategies can be integrated into research practices to inspire creativity and innovation, ultimately enriching the theoretical landscape of psychology.

The authors used information-theoretic measure of linguistic similarity to investigate the organization and evolution of scientific fields. An analysis of almost 20 M papers from the past three decades reveals that the linguistic similarity is related but different from experts and citation-based classifications, leading to an improved view on the organization of science. A temporal analysis of the similarity of fields shows that some fields (e.g. computer science) are becoming increasingly central, but that on average the similarity between pairs of disciplines has not changed in the last decades. This suggests that tendencies of convergence (e.g. multi-disciplinarity) and divergence (e.g. specialization) of disciplines are in balance.
